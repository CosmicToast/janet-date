# Guidelines for Contributing to Date
Thanks for taking the time to contribute!

This repository is relatively feature-complete.
If you can figure out a non-dirty way to add NetBSD style `_z`-terminated
functions, that would be an accepted feature.
Besides that, no further features will be accepted.

On the other hand, additional tests (especially if they point out errors in the
codebase), example files, and bug reports are highly welcome.
